//! CelMesh wire protocol.
//!
//! Every gossip frame is a JSON `Envelope`. A frame may carry one of
//! three payloads:
//!
//! * `Hello`   — sent on first contact with a peer.
//! * `Sync`    — a full delta of this node's view: membership rows
//!               plus the VMs it owns. Receivers merge by
//!               last-writer-wins on `(epoch, hlc)`.
//! * `Goodbye` — voluntary departure.
//!
//! The format is intentionally human-readable for the v0.1 sprint;
//! the only requirement on the surrounding transport is that frames
//! arrive intact and atomically. UDP datagrams already give us that.
